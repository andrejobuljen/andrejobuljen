### Hi!

I'm a cosmologist and computational astrophysicist currently at the [University of Zurich](https://www.astro.uzh.ch/en/). 

I worked on several topics in cosmology, in particular the Large-Scale Structure of the Universe: data analysis, statistical inference, mathematical modelling, numerical simulations and developing optimal algorithms to extract cosmological information from complex datasets. My publications can be found on [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1623816?ui-citation-summary=true), [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/p_=0&q=author%3A%22Obuljen%2C%20Andrej%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=-yLLY8EAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&authuser=1&sortby=pubdate).

I'm now mainly focussed and interested in machine learning, differentiable programming and simulation-based inference.
